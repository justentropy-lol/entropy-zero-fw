# ENTROPY ZERO firmware

This firmware is used as part of [ENTROPY ZERO](https://justentropy.lol), a DePIN that's also a memecoin.

For use on the network, one must obtain the required certificates from ENTROPY HQ.

A more detailed description of what this code does is available at in the [ENTROPY documentation](https://docs.puredepin.com/ENTROPY_ZERO/intro).

Feel free to modify the code in any way and use it to mine entropy. Even if you don't send it to us, we don't mind :grin:
